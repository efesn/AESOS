# Automated Error Searcher on StackOverFlow(AESOS)

The goal of the Automated Error Searcher on StackOverFlow (AESOS) is to save time for
programmers by quickly and efficiently finding solutions to programming errors on StackOverFlow.
By automating the search process, programmers can avoid the time-consuming task of manually
searching for solutions to their errors on the internet.

AESOS will automatically detect errors from given code file (might be any programming language),
open a browser and search for related pages on stackoverflow by using Stack Exchange API
including syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.
